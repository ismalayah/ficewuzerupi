However, he was previously married to Cherryn Krol in 1995 but later divorced. They had two daughters together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Cherryn Krol?</h2><p>Cherryn reportedly participated in philanthropic activities when she was younger. Together with Wycheck, she organized the “Wycheck Harley Ride,” which raised money for Tennessee’s Special Olympics.</p><p>Cherryn is said to have a strong appreciation for art and has used a variety of mediums to convey her ideas. She also dabbled in painting and interior design, according to Famous Fix.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Frank Wycheck career</h2><p>The Washington Redskins selected Wycheck in the sixth round of the 1993 NFL Draft (160th overall). In 1994, after hiring Norv Turner as their new coach, the Redskins attempted in vain to move Wycheck to fullback.</p><p>Wycheck tested positive for anabolic drugs and was suspended by the league later that season. The Redskins released Wycheck in 1995.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/11080531/b5d74683-244a-47a6-952c-954f9c6228a5-medium16x9_Frank.png><p>The Houston Oilers, who subsequently changed their name to the Tennessee Titans, signed him in 1995. Wycheck was a member of the Pro Bowl in 1999, 2000, and 1998.</p><p>In the 2000 Wild Card game against the Buffalo Bills, Wycheck’s involvement in the Music City Miracle is arguably what made him most well-known. With sixteen seconds left, the Titans were trailing 16–15.</p><p>After receiving a handoff from Lorenzo Neal, Wycheck tossed the ball to Kevin Dyson across the field, who turned it upfield for the game-winning score, which came 75 yards later.</p><p>That season, the Titans advanced to the Super Bowl but fell short by a score. Wycheck played for the Titans until the 2003 season when he announced his retirement.</p><p>During the course of his 11-year career, Wycheck racked up 505 receptions for 5,126 yards and 28 touchdowns, making him one of just 17 tight ends in NFL history to reach 500 receptions. Wycheck had three seasons (1999–2001) as the Titans’ top receiver.</p><p>With 14 receptions in the 1999 and 2002 postseasons, he twice tied the franchise record held by Jackie Harris and Tim Wilson.</p><p>Throughout his career, Wycheck also completed 5 of 6 passes for 148 yards, 2 touchdowns, and a perfect passer rating of 158.3, all on trick plays.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>At a press conference in Nashville on May 31, 2007, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling declared that a brawl between Wycheck and James Storm had interrupted the proceedings.</p><p>James Storm was given a guitar shot by Wycheck and Jeff Jarrett following the “Tennessee Cowboy” spat beer in the former Tennessee Titan’s face.</p><p>Next, TNA Wrestling would declare that Wycheck and James Storm have reached a verbal agreement to square off at Slammiversary on June 17, 2007.</p><p>Later that day, TNA’s website officially announced the bout. He and Jerry Lynn defeated Storm and Ron Killings in a tag match at Slammiversary. Lynn finished the fight with a Cradle Piledriver, which gave Wycheck the victory.</p><p>Up until his retirement from the game in 2001, Wycheck “hosted” his own Titan player show on WGFX 104.5 FM alongside George Plaster and Willy Daunic.</p><p>After Kevin Ingram and Mark Howard left The Wake Up Zone, Wycheck joined them as co-hosts on Nashville radio station WGFX’s “104.5 The Zone” morning drive-time program. Wycheck started doing color commentary for the Titans Radio Network during the 2005 season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/11080448/MjAyODE1Njk5MDM3NDYzNjIw-1024x576.webp?resize=770%2C433&ssl=1"><p>It was announced before the 2017 Titans preseason that Wycheck would be leaving his position as a color analyst because of unresolved brain injuries, he had during his football career.</p><p>Although his absence was only expected to last temporarily, Dave McGinnis, his substitute, came back for the 2018 and following seasons. In line with this, Wycheck departed The Wake Up Zone morning program in 2017.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp%2BpmqabYsS6r8eemqRlp56zpnnWoaZmr5Goeqe%2BwKeiZq%2BpmLWmr8qsZLChlpp8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffrank-wycheck-wife-who-was-frank-wychecks-wife.html&text=Frank%20Wycheck%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Was%20Frank%20Wychecks%20Wife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrank-wycheck-wife-who-was-frank-wychecks-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrank-wycheck-wife-who-was-frank-wychecks-wife.html&title=Frank%20Wycheck%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Was%20Frank%20Wychecks%20Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffrank-wycheck-wife-who-was-frank-wychecks-wife.html&title=Frank%20Wycheck%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Was%20Frank%20Wychecks%20Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffrank-wycheck-wife-who-was-frank-wychecks-wife.html&title=Frank%20Wycheck%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Was%20Frank%20Wychecks%20Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrank-wycheck-wife-who-was-frank-wychecks-wife.html&description=Frank%20Wycheck%20Wife%3a%20Who%20Was%20Frank%20Wychecks%20Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-nolan-arenados-wife-details-on-the-family-of-the-professional-baseball-third-baseman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Nolan Arenados Wife?
