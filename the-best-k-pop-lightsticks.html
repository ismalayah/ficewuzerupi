In the early 2000s, lightsticks replaced those balloons because they were a more durable and practical alternative. Lightsticks also make it easier for fans of multiple artists to switch and show their support for other groups.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=847 data-injectable=true>Each lightstick has defining characteristics that make it unique for each fandom. Some lightsticks are simple, but most feature well-crafted designs that represent the name of the fandom or the artist’s musical style. Every lightstick is special in its own way but there are definitely some that stand out among the crowd. To recognize some of the industry’s top lightsticks, we’ve created a list ranking 15 of our favorite K-Pop lightsticks based on creativity, design, and general vibes.</p><h2 id=h-15-the-boyz data-injectable=false>15.

The group announced their lightstick in April of 2021, and the device appears to be inspired by the group’s song “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Stealer</a>, which came out around the same time. ” While the lightstick doesn’t have an official name, members Juyeon and New suggested the name “Heart Bbyong Bong” when they officially announced the lightstick.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Bbyong/뿅 is a Korean onomatopoeia that mimics the sound of something popping, and this name would play on the phrase “heart bbyong bbyong” by replacing one of the “bbyong”s with the word for stick “bong/봉.” The Boyz’ lightstick does not act as a functioning megaphone, but it still looks cool. Fans can show their love with these lightsticks during the group’s current world tour.</p><h2 id=h-14-girls-generation data-injectable=false>14.

The lightstick has a relatively simple, streamlined design and prominently features the girl group’s official color of pink. The light on top is heart-shaped and has the Girls’ Generation logo (which also looks like a heart) inside.</p><p data-characters=584 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>The official name is highly debated, with some Sones (the Girls’ Generation fandom) calling it a “sarangni bong/사랑니봉” or “wisdom tooth bong” and others calling it an “eogumni bong/어금니봉” or “molar tooth bong.” For what it’s worth, the word for wisdom tooth contains the Korean word for love (sarang/사랑), which makes a lot of sense given the light’s cute heart shape. SNSD is less active than they were at the height of their career but these lightsticks work well during both solo or group concerts!</p><h2 id=h-13-epik-high data-injectable=false>13.

The compass on the lightstick is a “compass without direction.” This is meant to signify that even without something to guide them, Stray Kids will always find their way to their fans, Stays. The lightstick has the words “You make Stray Kids stay” printed on it as a message for Stays.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>The lightstick was first available for their concert at Seoul’s Olympic Hall on Nov. 23, 2019.

While never officially named, the lightstick is often referred to as Orbit Crown or Dalbit Bong. Dalbit/달빛 means moonlight in Korean and combines some of Loona’s Korean name (이달의소녀) with the fandom name Orbit.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>All members of Loona left Blockberry Creative and have signed with different agencies, though they state Loona has not disbanded.</p><h2 id=h-3-seventeen data-injectable=false>3.

The name Carat comes from their song “Shining Diamonds,” which they released before they even debuted. Soon after, the 13-member boy group started referring to their fans as Carats to signify the fans were the true diamonds. The Caratbong lights up in the official fandom colors, Rose Quartz and Serenity, and features a stunning diamond-shaped light.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=71 data-injectable=false>The group released their 11th EP, Seventeenth Heaven, on Oct. 23, 2023.</p><h2 id=h-2-g-i-dle data-injectable=false>2.

The group’s fans are known as Neverland, inspired by the island of eternal youth Peter Pan calls home. The girls picked the name because they hope (G) I-DLE will “eternally” stay by their fans’ side without changing. Their lightstick has a castle inside to represent the concept of Neverland.

The lightstick looks like a sphere held in place by eerie red shapes and when lit, emits a ghastly glow. The lightstick, which remains unnamed, comes in a coffin-shaped box, and at 785mm long, it is nearly twice the size of Loona’s lightstick. The girls also announced official cloaks for their fans — known as Insomnia — to wear to their concerts. We adore the commitment to Dreamcatcher’s concept and unique design.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>Dreamcatcher will release their ninth EP, Villains, on Nov. 22, 2023.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>There are many more lightsticks that we couldn’t feature on this list. We appreciate all the creativity and hard work that goes into creating these miniature art pieces fans use to support their K-Pop idols.
