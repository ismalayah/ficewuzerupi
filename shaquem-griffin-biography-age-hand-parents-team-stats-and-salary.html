He is the twin brother of Seahawks cornerback Shaquill Griffin, and both brothers played college football for the University of Central Florida Knights.</strong></p><p>As an amputee with one hand, Griffin received extensive media coverage as a prospective 2018 NFL Draft pick. He was selected as a fifth-round pick (141st overall) by the Seahawks on April 28, 2018, reuniting him with Shaquill.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=shaquem-high-school></span>Shaquem High School<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Griffin attended Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg, Florida. He played high school football for the Spartans. He chose to attend UCF after high school.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=shaquem-college></span>Shaquem College<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He is the twin brother of Seahawks cornerback Shaquill Griffin, and both brothers played college football for the University of Central Florida Knights. As an amputee with one hand, Shaquem received extensive media coverage as a prospective 2018 NFL Draft pick.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=shaquem-nfl-draft></span>Shaquem NFL Draft<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Griffin was named the 2018 Peach Bowl Defensive MVP and was the 2016 American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year. In Griffin’s senior season, UCF went undefeated and subsequently claimed a controversial national championship.[a] Griffin told Ralph Warner and NFL Network in November 2017 that he planned to continue his football career in the NFL.</p><p>Shaquem stayed at UCF one season longer than Shaquill, as Shaquem redshirted his freshman year while Shaquill saw playing time. Shaquill graduated and was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round (90th overall pick) of the 2017 NFL Draft, while Shaquem stayed on for his redshirt senior year at UCF.</p><p>Despite not initially receiving an invitation, Griffin participated in the NFL Scouting Combine in March 2018. He made headlines for performing 20 reps in the bench press while wearing a prosthesis and for running the 40-yard dash in 4.38 seconds, the fastest time for a linebacker since the NFL has released official statistics.</p><p>Despite the fact that he was not projected as a first-round pick, Griffin received an invitation to the 2018 NFL Draft, which he accepted on March 29, 2018. Griffin received extensive press and social media coverage leading up to and during the draft, as he would have been the first one-handed player drafted into the NFL if chosen. On April 28, 2018, he was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the fifth round (141st overall), reuniting him with his brother Shaquill. On May 17, 2018, Griffin signed a four-year deal worth $2.8 million with $300,000 guaranteed.</p><p>On August 9, 2018, Griffin made his preseason debut against the Indianapolis Colts in CenturyLink Field, leading his team in tackles with six solo tackles and three assisted tackles. On August 30, 2018, he again led the team in tackles with four solo and three assisted tackles in the final week of the preseason against the Oakland Raiders. Griffin led the Seahawks in total tackles for the entire 2018 NFL preseason with fifteen, tied with fellow linebacker Austin Calitro.</p><p>On September 9, 2018, Griffin was named as a starter in the first game of his NFL career due to veteran linebacker K.J. Wright being unable to play. He made three solo tackles in the 27-24 loss to the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=shaquem-ucf></span>Shaquem UCF<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Shaquem and his brother Shaquill were both offered football scholarships at the University of Central Florida (UCF) by then-coach George O’Leary, with Shaquill rejecting offers from other teams including the Miami Hurricanes, his dream team, to play with Shaquem. Griffin spent his whole college career at UCF, totaling 17 sacks and 30 tackles for a loss. Notable plays also include an interception versus the Temple Owls and a fumble recovery for a touchdown versus the Austin Peay Governors, both during the 2017 season.</p><p>In his second season, playing as a redshirt freshman, Shaquem had a brief stint as a second-string player on the depth chart before being demoted to third-string and then scout team. Griffin attributes his rise in his redshirt junior and redshirt senior seasons to Scott Frost’s hiring as head coach for the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Writing for The Players’ Tribune, Griffin said that, following his winless third season under O’Leary, “Coach Frost came in and brought me back into the light…He gave me the opportunity I had been waiting forever since I first arrived at UCF. And I took advantage of it.”</p><p>Griffin was named the 2018 Peach Bowl Defensive MVP and was the 2016 American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year. In Griffin’s senior season, UCF went undefeated and subsequently claimed a controversial national championship.[a] Griffin told Ralph Warner and NFL Network in November 2017 that he planned to continue his football career in the NFL.</p><p>Shaquem stayed at UCF one season longer than Shaquill, as Shaquem redshirted his freshman year while Shaquill saw playing time. Shaquill graduated and was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round (90th overall pick) of the 2017 NFL Draft, while Shaquem stayed on for his redshirt senior year at UCF.</p><p>After the end of his college career, Griffin was named as one of two recipients of the 2019 NCAA Inspiration Award, presented to individuals currently or formerly associated with NCAA athletics for especially inspirational efforts in dealing with life-altering personal situations. He received the award alongside Maggie Nichols, the first individual to report having been sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shaquem-griffin-age></span><span>Shaquem Griffin Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The American football linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks, Shaquem Alphonso Griffin, was born on 20 July 1995 in St. Petersburg, Florida, United States.
